Cortana is an attack scripting languaged used to extend the functionality of [Armitage](http://www.fastandeasyhacking.com/) or [Cobalt Strike](http://advancedpentest.com/).

A more comprehensive set of Cortana scripts is maintained by the creator of Cortana/Armitage/Cobalt Strike (Raphael Mudge) and is located at https://github.com/rsmudge/cortana-scripts

Raphael has also provided excellent tutorials on [Cortana](www.fastandeasyhacking.com/download/cortana/cortana_tutorial.pdf) as well as [Sleep](http://sleep.dashnine.org/documentation.html), the langauge Cortana is built on.
